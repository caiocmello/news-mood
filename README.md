# Is sentiment in the news becoming more negative over time? 

A recent [report](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2022/dnr-executive-summary) published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism analysing news consumption across different countries unveiled the increase in news avoidance. Among the reasons, one of the most common answers by interviewees was that ‘news negatively affect their mood’: 

>'The proportion of news consumers who say they avoid news, often or sometimes, has increased sharply across countries. This type of selective avoidance has doubled in both Brazil (54%) and the UK (46%) over the last five years, with many respondents saying news has a negative effect on their mood'.

However, in other countries like Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and Netherlands the variation was not considerable. 

This project compared the sentiment of news articles published by BBC on twitter in 2017, 2019 and 2022 to see if there is a variation of sentiment in the language used by news articles over time that could be related to how people feel the effect in their mood.
